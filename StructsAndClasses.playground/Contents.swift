 #### Contact
 
 1. Create a struct called Contact
 2. Add `name: String` and `phoneNumber: String` properties. Think about whether these should be constants or variables.
 3. Write an initializer that takes `name` and `phoneNumber` as arguments and initializes the corresponding properties using `self.` syntax
 */





/*:
 #### ContactManager
 
 1. Create a class called ContactsManager
 2. It should contain a variable array property called `contacts` whose type is an array of `Contact` structs
 3. Add a method (function) called `createContact(name: String, phoneNumber: String) -> Contact`. It should:
    - Initialize a new instance of Contact
    - Add it to the contacts property array
    - Return it
 */





/*:
 #### Test Your Code
 
 1. Create an instance of `ContactsManager`, and create various contacts using the `createContact` method.
 2. Print out the `ContactsManager` instance's `contacts` array to make sure they were added correctly. To access the array, remember to use dot syntax on the `ContactManager` instance you created in the previous step.
